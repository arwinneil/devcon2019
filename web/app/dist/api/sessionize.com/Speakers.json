    "fullName": "Yovan Fowdar",
    "bio": "Yovan Fowdar is always at the forefront of the fastest moving technology trends. Since his early teenage he had been exposed to computers and programming. Always wanting to live his passion to the fullest, he in parallel with his secondary studies, followed a professional course in computer programming where he was the youngest trainee there. \r\nWith his inquisitive mind he started exploring electronics, learning about transistors, IC, microprocessors, etc. He built his first commercial alarm system at the age of 19 whilst also pursuing his studies in telecommunication electronics.  In 1993 has started exploring and experimenting with Open Source OS  Linux Slackware  which was then in its early stage. \r\nHis first employment was at Unisys Mauritius where he was responsible for the networking and technical implementation of IT servers for the supreme court of Mauritius. He then seized an opportunity to work at Mauritius Telecom where he joined the newly created Data Unit.  He shouldered many responsibilities and worked in various fields, public telephone switch, commissioning of international ISDN links, Mauritius Telecom as an ISP, he was also a trainer for local staffs and for African international telecom operators.  After 7.5 years he resigned from Mauritius Telecom to join BNP Parisbas where he was the assistant IT manager he was there for  almost 1 year.  He then joined a start-up company ‘Card Business System and Applitel Ltd’ where he was the Technical Director. The company Card Business System developed solutions around Gemalto Smart Cards  for payment. CBS was rebranded as Expand Technology Holding Mauritius and grew rapidly into a Pan African Company with regional presence in more than 11 countries where he acquired many more areas of expertise in both technical and management field.  He has more than ten years of experience in Smart Cards security, VPN infrastructure, IP Telephony, servers physical and virtualized. He was, the R&D and Technical Director, IT Manager, Software Development Manager and also a board director of Expand Technology Holding (Mauritius) and Expand Technology Kenya.  \r\nAfter 12 years at Expand Technology Holding Ltd he decided to embark on a new adventure to live his passion and created his own company ‘Generation Plus Ltd’. He wants to take innovations to the next level where people will now be able to interact with the real world where systems/devices would be intelligently autonomous.  He has developed solutions using System on Chip (Soc), with a multitude of sensors, running Linux which allow smart control of existing household, office  & industrial devices;  locally  remotely and in an autonomous manner, those products have been fully developed in-house, meaning that there is no limit to customization to suit any requirement.  Areas of application are various just to mention a few projects, Smart Home, Smart Building, Hydroponic Plant production automation.  \r\nIn 2015 Yovan also co-founded the 1st  Maker Community in Mauritius where he plays an active role in promoting  innovative technology oriented initiatives (AI, Robotics, IoT, 3D Printing, microcontrollers , Single Board Computer, etc..) . Together with the MSCC The Mauritius Maker Community have a big  annual meetup, the  Devcon , where we organise free workshops and training . \r\nIn August 2018 Yovan  created the 1st  Makerspace in Mauritius, because having the right infrastructure/equipment is not something that everyone can afford, yet ideas can emerge from any individual.  Generation Plus  MakerSpace  aim is to promote  knowledge sharing , provide required infrastructure/facility and a hangout place for makers, to discuss about great ideas/projects. \r\n",
